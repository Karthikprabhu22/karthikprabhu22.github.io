I am a PhD candidate in Physics at UC Davis, specializing in theoretical cosmology and statistical data analysis. My academic journey began with a masterâ€™s degree in Natural Sciences from IISER Pune, where I cultivated a passion for theoretical cosmology, particularly the Cosmic Microwave Background.

My current research focuses on leveraging Bayesian inference and generative models to explore complex phenomena in cosmology. Highlights of my work include:

Developing a Variational Autoencoder-based model for Galactic dust to enhance cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.
Utilizing denoising diffusion models to study the cosmic infrared background, uncovering detailed non-Gaussian structures.
Utilizing a GPU-accelerated Bayesian parameter estimation pipeline, designed for analyzing high-resolution maps with millions of pixels.
Beyond research, I am committed to science communication and mentorship, regularly presenting at conferences like the American Physical Society meeting and engaging with public audiences through events like Astronomy on Tap.
