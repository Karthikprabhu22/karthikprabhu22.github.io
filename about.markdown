# About Me

I am **Karthik Prabhu Palimar**, a Physics Ph.D. candidate at **UC Davis**, specializing in **Theoretical Cosmology** and **Statistical Data Analysis**. My work involves leveraging **Bayesian techniques** and **Machine Learning** to derive physical insights from high-dimensional datasets, particularly in the context of **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** and **Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB)** analysis.

My research journey includes:
- Developing a **Bayesian parameter estimation pipeline** for CMB lensing potential analysis.
- Utilizing **denoising diffusion models** to model the Cosmic Infrared Background.

Currently, I am exploring full-time opportunities in **data science** and **machine learning**, aiming to apply my expertise in **generative models**, **analysis**, and **statistical methods** to solve impactful problems.
