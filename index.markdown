I am a PhD candidate in Physics at UC Davis, specializing in theoretical cosmology and statistical data analysis. My academic journey began with a masterâ€™s degree in Natural Sciences from IISER-Pune, where I cultivated a passion for theoretical cosmology, particularly the Cosmic Microwave Background.

My current research focuses on leveraging Bayesian inference and generative models to explore complex phenomena in cosmology. Highlights of my work include:

My work spans:
- **Generative AI** for scientific simulations  
- **Bayesian inference** for cosmological parameter estimation  
- **Scalable computational pipelines** with GPU acceleration
