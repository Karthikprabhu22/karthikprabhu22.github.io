I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of California, Davis. I specialize in theoretical cosmology and machine learning-driven astrophysical modeling. Under the supervision of Prof. Lloyd Knox, my research focuses on advancing precision in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) analysis through generative models and statistical inference frameworks.
