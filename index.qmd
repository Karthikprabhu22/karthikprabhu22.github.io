I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of California, Davis, working at the intersection of CMB cosmology and machine learning. My research focuses on building statistical and generative models to extract cosmological information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. I am currently exploring opportunities in data science, AI/ML, and research, preferably in Chicago area .


Some of my research interests are:

- Simulation-based inference and lensing pipelines for SPT-3G and future surveys  
- Generative models (VAEs, DDPMs) for non-Gaussian astrophysical foregrounds  
- Scalable, reproducible workflows for high-dimensional cosmological parameter estimation
