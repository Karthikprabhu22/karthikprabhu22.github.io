## Modeling Non-Gaussian Extragalactic Foregrounds with DDPMs*  
**Tech stack:** PyTorch · Accelerate · DDPMs  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Karthikprabhu22/diffusion_model)

- Built diffusion models to learn the joint non-Gaussian distribution of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and tSZ maps from the Agora simulations.  
- Generated fast, realistic CIB–tSZ samples that match 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point statistics of the training data.  
- Integrated DDPM-generated maps into lensing pipelines, reducing bias in reconstructed lensing power spectra on small angular scales.

## Forecasting ΛCDM Cosmological Constraints with SPT-3G*  
**Tech stack:** Python · Julia · Statistical Inference  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Karthikprabhu22/spt3g_forecasting_paper)

- Developed a covariance and parameter-forecasting framework for upcoming SPT-3G temperature, polarization, and lensing data.  
- Implemented optimal joint estimation of auto/cross-frequency covariance matrices for lensing and unlensed bandpowers.  
- Produced forecasts showing up to $\sim 2 \times$ tighter parameter constraints relative to Planck alone, enabling robust consistency tests of $\Lambda$CDM and its extensions.


## Generative Modeling of Galactic Dust with Variational Autoencoders  
**Tech stack:** Python · TensorFlow · CUDA · VAEs  
[GitHub](https://github.com/b-thorne/DustVAEder)

- Trained VAEs to model Galactic dust emission maps from Planck observations.  
- Demonstrated the ability to generate new dust realizations, reconstruct withheld maps, and perform constrained realizations.  
- Provided generative tools useful for simulation-based inference and foreground-cleaning tests for CMB experiments.


## Pawsitive Retrieval — RAG System over 5.5M Reddit Posts  
**Tech stack:** NLP · HuggingFace · LanceDB · LangChain
[GitHub](https://github.com/Karthikprabhu22/erdos_paware)

- Cleaned, normalized, and indexed a dataset of ~5.5M Reddit posts for large-scale retrieval experiments.  
- Fine-tuned a domain-specific embedding model for semantic search and question answering.  
- Achieved a **10–15% improvement** in retrieval quality (MRR, NDCG) relative to baseline transformer embeddings.

## Bayesian Inference Pipeline for CMB Lensing  
**Tech stack:** Julia · CUDA · Bayesian Inference  
[GitHub](https://github.com/marius311/CMBLensing.jl)

- Applied differentiable likelihood methods to extract non-Gaussian information from CMB temperature maps.  
- Improved constraints on lensing amplitude and higher-order CMB statistics beyond traditional two-point analyses.  
- Worked toward scalable, simulation-based inference techniques for next-generation CMB datasets.
