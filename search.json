    "text": "Karthik Prabhu Palimar is a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of California, Davis, specializing in theoretical cosmology and machine learning-driven astrophysical modeling. Under the supervision of Prof. Lloyd Knox, his research focuses on advancing precision in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) analysis through generative models and statistical inference frameworks.\nAs a member of the SPT-3G Collaboration, he develops scalable computational pipelines to disentangle astrophysical foregrounds from CMB signals, employing techniques such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion models (DDPMs) to simulate complex astrophysical emissions. His work enhances the accuracy of temperature, polarization, and gravitational lensing measurements, directly supporting cosmological investigations into dark matter and the early universe.\nKarthik’s interdisciplinary approach bridges physics, high-performance computing, and machine learning, with a focus on translating theoretical insights into robust, data-driven solutions for next-generation astrophysical surveys."
